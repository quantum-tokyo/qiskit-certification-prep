## üéØ Purpose (What & For Whom)

This repository provides unofficial practice questions for the
**IBM Certified Quantum Computation using Qiskit v2.X Developer ‚Äì Associate** exam.

It is designed for:

* Learners preparing for the certification who want hands-on practice.
* Developers already familiar with Python and basic linear algebra who want to test their **Qiskit v2.x skills**.
* Anyone who prefers to practice with **questions, explanations, and code snippets** before sitting the real exam.

This repo will help you get comfortable with both **theory** and **practical Qiskit coding tasks** you are likely to encounter.

## üìö Exam Domains

The official exam is structured into eight domains.

| Exam Domain                                           | Example Skills                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Performing quantum operations**                  | Single- and multi-qubit gates, composition   |
| **2. Visualizing circuits, measurements, and states** | `plot_histogram`, Bloch sphere, statevectors |
| **3. Creating quantum circuits**                      | Parametrized circuits, controlled gates      |
| **4. Running quantum circuits**                       | Backends, transpiler, job execution          |
| **5. Using the sampler primitive**                    | Sampling outputs, broadcast rules            |
| **6. Using the estimator primitive**                  | Expectation values, options tuning           |
| **7. Retrieving and analyzing results**               | Job metadata, result parsing                 |
| **8. Operating with OpenQASM 3**                      | Control flow, measurement feed-forward       |
